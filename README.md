You want a README.md file for the "Social Media Feed Clone" project.
Social Media Feed Clone
This project is a basic front-end implementation of a social media feed, designed to mimic the appearance and core functionality of platforms like Facebook or Twitter. It showcases posts with user information, content (text and images), and an interactive "like" button.

Features
Responsive Navbar: A top navigation bar that adapts to different screen sizes.

Static Posts: Displays pre-defined social media posts with:

User avatars and usernames

Timestamp (e.g., "2 hours ago")

Text content

Optional image content for posts

Basic comments section (static)

Interactive Like Button: Users can click to "like" or "unlike" a post. The like count updates visually, and the heart icon changes from outline to filled.

Clean UI/UX: A simple and intuitive design focusing on readability and ease of use.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the basic structure and content of the web page.

CSS3: For styling the layout, elements, and responsiveness.

JavaScript (ES6+): For interactive elements, specifically the like/unlike functionality.

Font Awesome: Used for social media icons (like heart, comment, share, home, user-friends, bell, cog).

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

A code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text)
